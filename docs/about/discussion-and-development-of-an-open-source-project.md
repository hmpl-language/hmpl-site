# Discussion and development of an open-source project

This product has a discussion platform on [github](https://github.com/hmpl-lang/hmpl/discussions). You can write your reviews or wishes about the project there. The project developer will try to answer you as soon as possible.

In the future, it is planned to maintain social networks, but for now the entire focus is only on the product.
